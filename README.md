# Hi there...

My name is Roger Panella.  I'm taking the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in Chicago and am at the beginning of my career as a developer.

## Before WDI ##
Before entering the program at General Assembly, I worked in internet marketing.  Specifically, I was an SEO Consultant, first at an agency here in Chicago, then as an independent consultant with my own company:  GroundSwell Search.

## Other Stuff ##

In addition to WDI stuff, here are a few things about me:
* I'm launching a concert review website called ShowSpeak soon.
* I'm a musician and play guitar.
* I like to cook, find, and eat vegan food.

Some cool web development things I've learned about so far include:

1. variables
2. loops
3. if statements
4. terminal
5. Github
6. operators

Here's some code to test out the box function in Markdown (I realize there's no need for a loop here. Just practicing.):

```
var music = prompt("What's your favorite kind of music?");
for (i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (music == "jazz") {
        console.log("Congratulations, you like good music!");
    } else {
        console.log("The music you listen too probably sucks.");
    }
```
